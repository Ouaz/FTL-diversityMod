# Shiny! Combat UI

- By Russian Rockman, compiled by Ouaz

Latest version: 1.0 (Oct 1, 2016)

Take the Combat UI overhaul from Russian Rockman's [Shiny! UI Overhaul and Graphics Mod v1.0](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=25839), to make a standalone mod.
The mod redesigns the combat box and adds some transparency to it: the background image is now visible, for a nice visual effect.

# Extended Pursuit Indicator x2

- By [Sleeper Service](http://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26289), modified by Ouaz (transparency increased to make the second ring appear a little less distracting)

Latest version: 1.1 (Oct 2, 2016)

A simple mod that adds additional layers to the fleet pursuit indicator on the map screen. The x2 number indicates how many additional rings are added to the indicator and means that the map will show how far the fleet will advanced after two jumps. The additional levels of the indicator won't adjust to nebula jumps.
