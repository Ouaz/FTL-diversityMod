# Detailed Ship Greebles Graphics 1.1

- By Lord Trilobite and Sleeper Service

Latest version: 1.1 (Nov 29, 2022)

Graphical mod that changes the underlying image for the ship interior that makes up the grey borders on the edge of the rooms.
What this mod does is replace that image with a more detailed cutaway view so that the rooms don't look like they are pasted on, but rather like they actually are part of the ship.

This mod includes detailed greebles for all vanilla ships and is fully compatible with 1.6.1+.
The 1.1 version removes unused xml files to prevent "junk file" warnings in Slipstream Mod Manager 1.9.1.
