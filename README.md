## diversityMod 0.5

Graphical mod replacing redundant weapon icons and projectiles by new ones, which makes easier the visual differentiation between weapons and their respective damage powers in game.

Based on [FTL diversity Mod 0.3](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3363) by liakad (then improved successively by [alextfish](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3363&start=20#p21807) and [Istarune](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3363&start=30#p23888)), this new mod version updates all outdated, missing, or modified weapons stats/values to vanilla state, and removes non-vanilla weapons code existing in v0.3.

The mod is now fully compatible with AE and is **graphical** only (it does NOT change any game values). Not compatible with any other weapon-mod.
Fully compatible with FTL 1.6.1+ to support any language. Not compatible anymore with FTL 1.5.x.
