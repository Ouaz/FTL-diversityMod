# FTL: diversityMod

Latest version: 0.4 (Sep 25, 2016)

This mod for Faster Than Light is purely cosmetic and replaces redundant weapons icons and projectiles by new ones,  which makes easier the visual differentiation between weapons and their respective damage powers in game.

This mod is based on [FTL diversity Mod 0.3](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3363) by liakad (then improved successively by [alextfish](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3363&start=20#p21807) and [Istarune](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3363&start=30#p23888)), but it updates all outdated, missing, or modified weapons stats/values to vanilla state, and removes non-vanilla weapons code existing in v0.3.

So the mod is now fully compatible with AE and is graphical only (it does NOT change any game values). 

See [Changelog](https://github.com/Ouaz/FTL-diversityMod/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for further information.

Fully compatible with FTL Advanced Edition. Not compatible with any other weapon-mod.
